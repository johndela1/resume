\section{\centerline{BACKGROUND INFORMATION}}
I have always had an interest in computers and physics.  When I was
14 years old, I developed, maintained and operated a computer
bulletin board system with custom software and hardware.  I received
calls and inquiries from users throughout the United States.  I
have formalized my computer knowledge by attending classes in C,
C++, Unix, Database Design, System Analysis and Design, Statistics,
Calculus and various business courses.   During my senior year at
Cal State Fullerton, because of my performance and abilities, I
received the honor of being the single student that was selected
to make a formal presentation of my final database project.
