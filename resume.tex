\section{\centerline{Experience}}

{\large \bf TVplus, Orange, CA \hfill August 2012 to Jan 2014}

\begin{itemize}

\item

Created a system for locally caching parts of a large remote database.
Remote data was represented by a graph and the local data was a set
of trees.  Each tree represented an entity or topic in the larger remote
graph.  The cache provided write operations which made sure local
changes where available immediately and pushed back to remote database.
There was a configuration system for specifying how remote structures
would be mapped to local structures based on their type.  The top layer
was an interface that provided functions to query and edit the data.

\item
Wrote a program for reconciling schedule changes in a system that managed
TV show schedules and associated content.  A schedule database
contained the schedule for next two weeks and associated content was
added to scheduled events based on their channel and their start time.
Every 24 hours the schedules would get updated.  This could mean events
where removed, added, or moved.  My system would make sure to reattach
content for shows that moved in time (if it could be a match) and flag
all other cases of disassociated content for human intervention.



Main input was XML that
described the programs and schedule for the next two weeks.  


Rewrote a program that was used to download schedule and program
data in the form of XML.  The data were added to and merged with existing
data on a nightly basis.  This program ran in the background and proved
to be very stable.  This was written in Python and used MongoDB as
a database.

\item Automated video processing work.  Before this work, there was a
person who had to take videos and cut them up, insert blanks spots, and
mute commercials, based on a set of time offsets provided to them.  They
also had to generate a hash and upload it to a third part and then edit
a remote JSON config file.  This was automated using Python and ffmpeg.
The user would submit the offset file and the program would do the rest.

\item setup  development  environment using LXC to allow a single server
to run several systems to approximate our production environment which
was spread across many amazon EC2 nodes.

\item Dealt with routing, firewall, working with ISP, DNS,
installing software, etc.  Ran PostgreSQL, MongoDB, git server
over ssh, iptables, BIND, Apache. 

\end{itemize}


{\large \bf RK Hydroponics, Huntington Beach, CA \hfill Mar 2009 to Feb

2012} \begin{itemize}

\item Brought up U-Boot and the mainline kernel on AT91 ARM hardware.

\item Created control software that was used in controlling salt levels
in a hydroponic nutrient solution.  Samples would be read in from EC
(electrical conductivity) sensor and used as feedback to a control loop
which would add or withhold water in order to keep salinity from rising.
This prevented large swings in the salinity level, which made it possible
to reuse the solution several times as opposed to being dumped after a
single use.

\item each system reported 
\end{itemize}

{\large \bf Teradek, Irvine, CA (contractor) \hfill Jul 2008 to Dec 2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed software in C that would run on ARM and PowerPC
\item Worked with TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets to manage video streams for
a device with multiple cameras as inputs.
\item Created Lua scripts to control video codec.
\item Cross compiled kernel modules and user space programs for various
pieces of hardware on an embedded Linux platform; Devices such as USB
ports, GPS modules, 802.11g adapters
\end{itemize}

{\large \bf Tadpole, Torrance, CA (contractor) \hfill Aug 2007 to Jun 2008}
\begin{itemize}

\item Managed Apache web server that was used for running bug
tracking system and web mail.

\item Built custom Linux distribution to be installed on in-car
computer where our navigation system was going to run.

\item Wrote Python package that would let users view their location
map, zoom, and scroll back in time to see where they had come from
and retrace their path.

\item Worked on a small team to create a system where users could
track the location of their friends and share areas of interest.

\end{itemize}

{\large \bf CreditVision, Pasadena, CA \hfill Nov 2006 to Jan Aug 2007}
\begin{itemize}

\item Worked on existing web application that used mod\_perl, Apache,
and Oracle to provide customers with merged credit reports.  When he
started this job, the previous developer had just left on short notice.
Things where not stable and there was no documentation.  He got up to
speed, fixed some of the bugs that caused the stability issues, and
helped expand the system to provide redundancy for fail over.  When he
left the company they had a system that was well documented and required
very little maintenance.

\item Installed and administered Linux, Apache, Oracle, Open BSD on off
site server located in a nearby data center.

\end{itemize}

{\large \bf ETAS, Santa Barbara, CA (contractor) \hfill Jan 2006 to Jun 2006}
\begin{itemize}

\item Maintained and tested Linux kernel to run on an embedded system
(ARM) for use in automotive industry.

\item Involved forward porting of existing patches, and locating and
applying new patches.

\end{itemize}


{\large \bf First American RES, Anaheim, CA \hfill May 2001 to April 2005}
\begin{itemize}

\item Wrote and maintained web-apps written mainly in Java that ran with
Apache, Tomcat, and Weblogic on Linux and Solaris.

\item Designed and debugged automate build process.

\item Maintained 40 to 45 production Linux servers that serve as
web-servers, proxy servers, and application servers.

\item Created and maintained configuration files, SSL keys and
certificates, shell scripts used to deploy apps and analyze log data to
create reports.

\item Developed remote deployment system using shell scripting and ssh.

\item  Worked with Solaris, Oracle, Weblogic, Apache, bash, Perl,
Python, SQL, Linux, AIX, C, Java.

\end{itemize}
