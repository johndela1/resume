\section{\centerline{EXPERIENCE}}
{\large \bf TVplus, Orange, CA \hfill August 2012 to Jan 2014}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed, documented, and wrote a set of programs that would fetch
data from third party sources (Freebase, DBpedia, etc) and transform it
for local use.  This involved meeting with mangement and figuring
out how they needed the data presented.  Once decided upon, I created
the data structures and wrote the code.
This envovlved prototyping two ideas then ruling one out after getting
more feedback.  There was a program to grab the raw data and write
it to a local
database.  The next program transformed it to a data structure that
was smaller and just enough for the presentation.  This new structure
was stored in the local database for direct use by the presentation layer.
The presentation
was accessed from a REST api.  The presentation code would do some
minor transforms (flatening or showing a specific node in the tree) on
the stored data and present it.

I used SQL Expression Language (SQLAlchemy) on PostgreSQL.

\item TMS parser scraper

\item Automated the task of adding blank inserts and mutting
videos (ffmpeg, python).

server over ssh, iptables, BIND, Nginx.

\item Participated in peer reviews of code.
