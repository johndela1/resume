I am someone who really enjoys programming and playing with computers
in general.  I am most comfortable in a Linux environment, although
I have done work with other Unix variants.  My favorite languages are
Python, C, and Scheme.  I have never used Scheme for more than a
learning tool, but have learned a lot about making programs easier
to debug in other languages by thinking about things from a functional
point of view.

I would consider my self someone who has worked on the full stack.  I've
worked on projects where I was responsible for the installation and
configuration of the OS, DNS, database server, schema, server side code,
web server, router/firewall, and even some front end javascript.

When forced to write front end or GUI code, I usually use default
widgets and colors expecting lots of feedback on asthetics issues.

I understand requirements change as the development process
reveals more insights.  I am ok with things changing.  I am also a big
fan of peer view and appreciate having my code seen by others and questioned.
