Since an early age, I have always been curious and fascinated by computers.
As a child, I was drawn to computers partially due to graphics and
video games.  Later I became more interested in operating systems and
networking.  I have spent time writing low level code as
well as high level code in many languages.  While in school I was exposed
to relational databases and found them to be another interest of mine.

I am quite aware that the computer business is just that a business.
At my last job, I spent time profiling network and memory usage and
was able to make changes that had cost savings.  For example, after
changing some network code to use a different type of handshake on
the initial connection we lowered our AWS bill by \$20k/month.

Programming has been a passion of mine.  I have spent much time reading
books and reading lots of source code from successful projects and
unsuccessful projects as well.  I have come to realize that writing code
that avoids adding accidental complexities and ends with code that is
as simple as possible is key to making systems that can be maintained and
extended easily.  One of the biggest compliments I received was after
giving my code to a new maintainer and he said, 'Reading your code is
a joy'.

Along with programming I also enjoy building systems.  By this I mean
creating things that involve many programs working together.


Sincerly,
