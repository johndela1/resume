I am interested in the Senior Software Engineer position.  I learned
about the job on the careers.stackoverflow.com site.

I have been using my programming and systems skills to solve problems
for over 10 years.  In this time I have learned how to think about system
architectures, data structures, and code.  Although I am confident with
my skills I spend a large amount of my free time learning more about
these things.  I do this mainly by reading a lot of source code and
documentation to see how people are doing things.

I have worked on a wide variety of projects like database applications,
back end systems, and embedded systems.
