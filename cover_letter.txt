I am someone who really enjoys programming and playing with computers
in general.  I am most comfortable in a Linux environment, although
I have done work with other Unix variants.  My favorite languages are
Python, C, and Scheme.  I have never used Scheme for more than a
learning tool, but have learned a lot about making programs easier
to debug in other languages by thinking about things from a functional
point of view.

I would consider my self someone who has worked on the full stack.  I've
worked on projects where I was responsible for the database server,
schema, middle layer code, web server, router/firewall, and even some front
end javascript.

I prefer a position where I am given some control over how to
impliment the details, but have no problem learning new ways of doing
things.

I've done a lot of programming
	I've been the lead on several projects
	I understand requirements change as the development process
		reveals more insights.


I've been a sysadmin
	installed linux
	ran BIND, etc
